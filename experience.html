                <ul>
                    <li>Contributed to Submitty, an open-source course management, assignment submission, exam, and
                        grading
                        system used by a dozen of universities. Collaborated with another student intern and an ex-eBay
                        mentor.<a href="https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues/10445"

                    </li>
                    <li>Developed a “Curve Component” within the grading rubric interface using PHP,
                        allowing
                        instructors to add, manage, and apply grading curves to assignments and exams.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced the grading process by introducing a one-click feature within the “Curve Component”
                        that
                        can
                        apply the curve to all student submissions.</li>
                    <li>Optimized the grading curve from a fixed-point system to a piecewise linear formula, enabling
                        equitable
                        adjustments based on student performance. <a
